Self-help - Phobias
    
  














Each phobia is different and no single self-help programme will work for everyone. You may decide to use your own self-help strategy or get help from a mental health specialist, such as a psychologist.
A self-help programme could include:
lifestyle changes
a course of 
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
attending a self-help group
using exposure therapy to overcome your fear
a combination of these






Lifestyle changes
Making some simple changes to your lifestyle may help reduce the 
symptoms of a phobia
, such as 
panic attacks
.
This could include:
regular exercise
eating regular, healthy meals
getting enough 
sleep
reducing or avoiding caffeine and other stimulants






Exposure therapy (desensitisation)
Exposure therapy involves gradually increasing the length of time you're exposed to your phobia.
For example, if you have 
agoraphobia
, a fear of open spaces and public places, you might start by going outside your house for a very short period of time, before gradually increasing the length of time you spend outside and the distance you travel from your house.
Exposure therapy can be a very effective way of enabling you to cope with your 
anxiety
.






Other self-help techniques
Other self-help techniques include:
relaxation techniques – a series of physical exercises that help you relax and control your breathing
visualisation – combines relaxation and breathing techniques with mentally visualising how you'll successfully deal with a situation that could cause anxiety
self-help groups – a useful way of meeting others with similar experiences and sharing ways of coping
